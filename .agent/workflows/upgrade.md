# /upgrade — Framework Upgrade

> **Trigger**: `/upgrade [sub-command]`
> **Lifecycle**: Maintenance — when new kit version available

> Standards: See `rules/workflow-standards.md`

> [!CAUTION]
> Upgrades modify `.agent/` files. Preservation Contract protects user state. Always verify after upgrade.

---

## Critical Rules

1. Non-destructive only — use `kit update`, never `init --force`
2. Preservation Contract — user state (rules, checklists, sessions, decisions, contexts, identity) must survive
3. Always run `kit verify` post-upgrade
4. Human confirmation required before executing upgrade

---

## Argument Parsing

| Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/upgrade` | Interactive — detect, preview, apply, verify |
| `/upgrade --dry-run` | Preview only |
| `/upgrade --verify-only` | Post-upgrade verification only |

---

## Steps

// turbo
1. **Pre-Upgrade** — check current version, verify clean working tree, record HEAD for rollback

// turbo
2. **Preservation Snapshot** — verify all protected items exist, record checksums

3. **Execute Upgrade** — `kit update` (requires user approval)

// turbo
4. **Verify Integrity** — `kit verify`, confirm preserved items intact

// turbo
5. **Report** — version change, new capabilities, preservation compliance
