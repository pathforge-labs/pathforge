description: PathForge Tier-1 Quality Gate - Mandatory pre-task research and validation protocol
---

# /quality-gate — Pre-Task Research & Validation Protocol

> **Trigger**: `/quality-gate` — mandatory before implementation of new features or refactors
> **Lifecycle**: Before `/plan` — research informs planning
> **Output**: `docs/RESEARCH-{slug}.md`

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a mandatory governance gate. You must complete market research, gap analysis, and ethics review before any implementation begins. Approval required.

## 🔴 Critical Rules

1. **RESEARCH FIRST** — no implementation without validated research
2. **EVIDENCE-BASED** — all claims backed by market data or competitor analysis
3. **ETHICS GATE** — privacy, bias, and automation risks must be evaluated
4. **APPROVAL REQUIRED** — present findings to Product Owner before proceeding

## Scope Filter

| Task Type                         | Quality Gate Required? |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| `feat()` — new features           | ✅ Required            |
| `refactor()` — structural changes | ✅ Required            |
| `fix()` — bug fixes               | ❌ Skip                |
| `chore()` — maintenance           | ❌ Skip                |
| `docs()` — documentation          | ❌ Skip                |
| `test()` — test additions         | ❌ Skip                |

## Steps

Execute IN ORDER. Do not skip any step.

### Step 1: Market Research

// turbo

Research the task domain across minimum 5 market leaders:

- Identify the top competitors for the feature domain
- For PathForge job-platform features: LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Stepstone, Hired, Jobscan, Rezi, Teal, Huntr, LazyApply
- For other domains: identify the category leaders
- Document: how is this feature implemented today?
- Document: why did users adopt it? What outcomes does it drive?

### Step 2: Comparative Analysis

// turbo

Produce a comparison table:

| Competitor | Approach | AI/ML Methods | UX Pattern | Automation Level | Data Privacy |
| :--------- | :------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------------- | :----------- |
| {leader 1} | ...      | ...           | ...        | ...              | ...          |

### Step 3: Gap Detection

// turbo

Identify and document:

- Where PathForge meets/exceeds market standards
- Where PathForge is BELOW market level
- Outdated patterns in current/proposed approach
- If the approach uses deceptive, spammy, or harmful patterns → **REJECT**

### Step 4: Enhancement Strategy

// turbo

Define how PathForge improves upon the market baseline:

- More transparent? (explainable metrics, clear scoring)
- More ethical? (human-in-the-loop, consent-first)
- More user-centric? (measurable funnel insights)
- More data-sovereign? (local-first processing, user-owned data)
- More accurate? (semantic analysis over keyword matching)

**Rule:** Never replicate without improvement.

### Step 5: Ethics, Bias & Automation Safety

// turbo

Evaluate:

- Privacy implications (GDPR, personal data handling)
- AI bias risks in scoring, matching, or recommendations
- Automation safety (rate limiting, anti-spam, ToS compliance)
- User autonomy (human-in-the-loop preserved?)
- Mitigation strategies for each identified risk

### Step 6: Research Summary

// turbo

Compile findings into `docs/RESEARCH-{slug}.md`:

1. Research summary (from Steps 1-5)
2. Key insights extracted
3. Risks of weak approaches
4. Proposed PathForge-grade solution
5. Why this approach is superior
6. Dependencies and blockers

### Step 7: Present for Approval

Present the Research Report to the Product Owner via `notify_user`.
**Implementation may NOT begin until explicit approval is received.**
After approval, proceed to `/plan` for structured task planning.

## Rejection Triggers

If any of these conditions are met, **REJECT** the task:

1. ❌ No market research for this feature domain
2. ❌ Approach uses outdated or harmful patterns
3. ❌ Solution is below market standard
4. ❌ Ethics/privacy/automation risks unmitigated
5. ❌ "Just implement it" without research justification

## Governance

**PROHIBITED:** Implementing without research · skipping competitor analysis · ignoring ethics review · proceeding without approval · marking research "complete" without evidence

**REQUIRED:** Minimum 5 competitors analyzed · enhancement over baseline documented · all risks mitigated · output saved to `docs/RESEARCH-{slug}.md` · Product Owner approval

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Market research completed (≥5 competitors)
- [ ] Comparative analysis table produced
- [ ] Gap detection documented
- [ ] Enhancement strategy defined (improvement over baseline)
- [ ] Ethics/bias/automation review completed
- [ ] Research report saved to `docs/RESEARCH-{slug}.md`
- [ ] Presented to Product Owner and approved
